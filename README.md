KeyStroke
=========

Development of a new programming language called KeyStroke. Intended to be a general purpose language that aims to make text based programming the easiest it can possibly be but still have all the standard libraries you would expect from a programming language.

The first version of the language is being worked on now - this includes the interpreter. Once I have the some of the key features intergrated I will upload the source for anyone to see, modify or distribute. Any help with the code will be greatly appreciated.

If you're interested in working on this project you will need to know how to code in Python and of course, have a small general understanding of how programming langauges are build.

Any questions don't hesitate to email me: will704@hotmail.co.uk
